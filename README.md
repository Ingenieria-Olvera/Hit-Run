# Hit-Run

I have always loved good movement in video games, so when I was a freshman I decided I would create my own game that would incoperate all things that I loved about movement. And while I never finished this, I still learned a decent amount of things when it comes to video game programming.

I have lost the code due to it being on my previous computer along with the whole game file, yet here is all the code that I found from old emails of me emailing them to myself from my school email in highschool.

I started this project as a sophmore in Highschool and I have not updated any of the code since. That being said I am aware that now coding in unity is quite different yet I was very proud of this code. If I ever do decide to comeback to try and finish this project, I will 100% update everything here.
